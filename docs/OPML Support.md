# OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) Support
The RssToolkit also has support for OPML feeds [http://www.opml.org/spec](http://www.opml.org/spec) which allows you to list a number of feeds (referred to as Outlines) that can then be individually referenced or aggregated. When used with the RssToolkit, an OPML file (or feed URL) will cause each referenced feel to be be fetched and processed and the resulting items merged into (at this time) chronological order. This allows you to create an OPML file (or feed) that looks something like this:
{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<opml version="1.1">

Which will result in a single generated feed that aggregates the contents of the two feeds mentioned into a single feed.  If you are using the base {{RssDocument}} class, you can access all of the items using the standard {{Items}} property and the OPML feed (or file) can be loaded using any of the standard {{Load}} overrides as shown in the +Using **{{RssDocument}}** class+ section of the [Consuming Feeds](Consuming-Feeds) documenation.
